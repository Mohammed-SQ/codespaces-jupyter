# ICS104 — Python Practice Project (KFUPM)

This is a small project to practice Python for the ICS104 course at KFUPM.

What is here
- `test.py`: a small example you can run and edit.

How to start
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run `python3 test.py` to see a small demo.

```
python3 test.py
```

What to try
- Change `test.py` to learn variables, loops, and functions.
- Add a new file or a Jupyter notebook if you like.

Keep your changes small and try one idea at a time. If you get stuck, ask your teacher or a classmate. Have fun learning Python!
